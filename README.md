# Iris Classification Project

## Description
This project demonstrates the classification of Iris flower species using a machine learning model. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which contains three classes of Iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The objective is to build a classifier that can accurately predict the species of an Iris flower based on the input features.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each with 4 features:
- Sepal length in cm
- Sepal width in cm
- Petal length in cm
- Petal width in cm

The target variable is the species of the Iris flower, which can be one of the following:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the project environment.

## About code
